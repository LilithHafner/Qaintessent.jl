## Features

Qaintessent.jl is a Quantum Circuit simulator, representing Quantum states in state vector form. This library allows the creation of Quantum circuits as combinations of basic Quantum Gates (See [Gates](@ref) for details regarding elementary gates and [Circuit Construction and Usage](@ref) for details regarding Circuit Construction). This library also supports gradient calculation for parametrized gates to be used for optimization algorithms, such as Machine Learning or QAOA.
